    <h3>What is adobo?</h3>

    <p>Adobo is way of preserving food by ancient filipino natives in pre-refregiration days, Adobo utilizes the acid in the 
         vinegar and the high salt content of soy sauce to produce an undesirable environment for bacteria.  
        </p>


    <p> The term adobo is derived from the Spanish word "adobar", meaning marinade. The practice of marinating meat in a flavorful 
        mixture made from vinegar, salt, garlic, paprika, and oregano was common to Spanish cooking. 
        Spanish colonists gave the name “adobo” to the cooking method indigenous to the Philippines, as their marinades were so similar.
