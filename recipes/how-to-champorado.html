    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Champorado is a Filipino chocolate rice porridge that is traditionally served for breakfast.
        <br>champorado is made using blocks of bittersweet cocoa combined with powdered milk and sugar called "tablea" 
        </p>
    <p>It’s best with a lot of milk and a dash of sugar. Filipinos love eating champorado on rainy days, especially when it is paired with what we call ‘tuyo’.
         ‘Tuyo’ in english means ‘dry’. In the Philippines, dried fish are simply called ‘tuyo’ and are usually eaten with fried rice, tomatoes and vinegar with garlic for breakfast, or with the mouth-watering ‘champorado’.
